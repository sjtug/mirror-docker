# This is a simple mirroring script. To save bandwidth it first checks a
# timestamp via HTTP and only runs rsync when the timestamp differs from the
# local copy. As of 2016, a single rsync run without changes transfers roughly
# 6MiB of data which adds up to roughly 250GiB of traffic per month when rsync
# is run every minute. Performing a simple check via HTTP first can thus save a
# lot of traffic.

# Directory where the repo is stored locally. Example: /srv/repo
target=$LUG_path

# Directory where files are downloaded to before being moved in place.
# This should be on the same filesystem as $target, but not a subdirectory of $target.
# Example: /srv/tmp
# tmp=""

# Lockfile path
# lock="/var/lock/syncrepo.lck"
lock="/var/lock/sync_arch_repo.lck"

# If you want to limit the bandwidth used by rsync set this.
# Use 0 to disable the limit.
# The default unit is KiB (see man rsync /--bwlimit for more)
bwlimit=0

# The source URL of the mirror you want to sync from.
# If you are a tier 1 mirror use rsync.archlinux.org, for example like this:
# rsync://rsync.archlinux.org/ftp_tier1
# Otherwise chose a tier 1 mirror from this list and use its rsync URL:
# https://www.archlinux.org/mirrors/
# source_url=''
source_url=$LUG_source

# An HTTP(S) URL pointing to the 'lastupdate' file on your chosen mirror.
# If you are a tier 1 mirror use: http://rsync.archlinux.org/lastupdate
# Otherwise use the HTTP(S) URL from your chosen mirror.
# lastupdate_url=''
